## Inspiration
As someone who wants to learn more about our universe, I thought a website that teaches us something daily about our universe would be great. I also believe that this website should not only provide information through text, but through images as well to provide a better understanding. 

## What it does
Cosmic Daily is an engaging and educational platform that brings the universe's wonders to your fingertips. It presents a new and stunning image of space every day accompanied by an informative description written by professional astronomers, providing insights into the depicted celestial objects and phenomena. 

## How we built it
This website is built using React.js. The information is provided through NASA's APOD API. 

## Challenges we ran into
1. I ran out of time so I wasn't able to create a landing page. 
2. I had a lot of trouble getting the NASA APOD API to work. The key for some reason wasn't valid. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
1. I am proud that I was able to get this website together during the time constraints of the hackathon. 
2. I am proud that I was able to complete a project that users can use to learn. 

## What we learned
I learned how to use the NASA APOD API. This was my first time using the NASA API with React.js. 

## What's next for Cosmic Daily 
1. I will be adding a landing page for this site. 
2. I will add more features to provide users with more opportunities to learn.
